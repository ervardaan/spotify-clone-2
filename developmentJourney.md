### setup
- aff `rfc` to app.js to get boilerplate code and rmeove addTests, webvitals etc files as we won't be using them for analytics of the application
- make a new folder in `src` folder called `utils` with files  `stateProvider.jsx` and `reducer.js`
- create stateContext and stateProvider in `stateProvider.jsx` file
- create reducer in `reducer.js` file
### logging in functionality
- create new folder components in src called `components` and then make 1st component called `Login.jsx`
- initialize this login component using rfc to get another boilerplate code to get started
- make a container  and style it like a div using styled components which we have already installed and need to import `styled` from `styled-components`
